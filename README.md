Browser extension to put swear words in a calligraphy font.

The dictionary for this extension is hard-coded. Because I thought some of the words might go against GitHub's rule against "sexually obscene content", I have replaced them here.

I thought I would be able to make this extension as a simple [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) fork, but it turns out styling text is a lot more complicated than replacing text. I am pretty proud of this algorithm because I think it could have a lot more uses aside from this silly one.
