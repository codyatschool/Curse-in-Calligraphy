You can download the Safari version of this extension [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1onlYP2_eMaFtjASAmYNDmu6YALTKWSdn/view?usp=sharing). It is [unsigned](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) because I currently don't want to pay for an Apple Developer Program membership, so you'll have to [re-enable it every time you launch Safari](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension#2957925).

The dictionary for this extension is hard-coded. Because I thought some of the words might go against GitHub's rule against "sexually obscene content", I have replaced them here.

I thought I would be able to make this extension as a simple [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) fork, but it turns out styling text is a lot more complicated than replacing text. I am pretty proud of this algorithm because I think it could have a lot more uses aside from this silly one.
